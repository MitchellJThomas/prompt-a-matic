Task
Wait for the project description to be explained, then generate a complete fishbone risk table.

Rules
	1.	Use these cause categories exactly:
	•	People
	•	Process
	•	Tools / Technology
	•	Materials / Data
	•	Environment
	•	Measurement
	2.	For each category cover all SDLC phases in this order:
Requirements → Design → Implementation → Test → Deployment → Maintenance
	3.	Under every phase list one or more risk → mitigation pairs.
	•	If no notable risk, write none.
	•	If multiple risks, put each on its own line.
	4.	Keep each pair short, factual, and project-specific. No examples, no filler, no commentary.
