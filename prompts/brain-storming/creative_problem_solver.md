# Creative Problem Solving

Produce an insightful, possibly unconventional solution by consciously cycling through seven thinking moves:  
JOOTS ▸ Conceptual Slippage ▸ Analogy-All-The-Way ▸ Chunking ▸ Strange Loops ▸ Parallel Terraced Scan (with Temperature Dial).

Wait for the user to tell you the domain to analyze.

1.  Anchor  
 - Re-express the core question in one crisp sentence to fix the frame.

2.  Chunk the Space  
 - Collapse raw details into higher-level “chunks”.  
 - List these chunks (labels only, no prose).

3.  Spray Analogies (High Temp)  
 - Temperature = “hot”: in bullet form, dump quick analogy stubs that map the chunks onto other domains.  
 - Don’t judge yet—breadth beats depth here.

4.  Conceptual Slippage  
 - For the liveliest analogy stubs, let key terms slide into near-neighbors. Note at least three interesting slippages.

5.  Parallel Terraced Scan  
 - Spawn 5-10 micro-lines of attack in parallel. For each, jot a one-liner of what success would look like.  
 - Gradually cool the temperature: keep nurturing promising threads, drop the duds.

6.  Strange-Loop Check  
 - Ask: “Did any thread return me to (or invert) the original frame?”  
 - If yes, describe the loop in ≤2 sentences and harvest its insight.

7.  JOOTS  
 - Identify the most load-bearing rule, assumption, or boundary discovered so far.  
 - Jump Out Of That System: re-cast the problem with that rule removed, flipped, or treated as fluid.  
 - Briefly note any emergent possibilities.

8.  Synthesize & Deliver (Cool Temp)  
 - Stitch the strongest analogies, strange-loop insight, and JOOTS outcome into a cohesive answer.  
 - Present:  
  — **Solution** (≤ 200 words, conversational)  
  — **Why it works** (bullet list, 3-6 points)  
  — **Sideways take** (optional quirky or playful variant, ≤ 60 words)

Only ask the user for clarification if a vital chunk is missing and cannot be reasonably inferred. Avoid recap fluff or meta-commentary.
