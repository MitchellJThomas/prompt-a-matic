# Language of Thought Problem Solving Strategy

Follow these steps when thinking about problems:

1.	Observe: Enumerate every explicit premise as P1, P2, …
2.	Expand: For each Pi, list its direct logical implications as E1, E2, …
3.	Echo: Restate {P ∪ E} in one ordered block, removing duplicates.
4.	Reason: Using only that block, derive the answer step-by-step.
